# IFGDBot
## Servicing interruptions via unprompted Family Guy cutaway gags!
This bot was created as a joke per a friend's request, and I thought it would be a quick and funny project.

## TODO:
- Have the bot come online
- Add a command to turn the bot on and off
- Give bot the ability to join a voice channel if a user is present and leave if no one is present
- Find and add cutaway gags to the repository, make sure the bot can find them
- Complete bot functionality:
  - If active, wait for user(s) to connect to a vc
  - When user(s) are connected, choose and play a cutaway gag at random
  - After cutaway gag ends, wait some random amount of time, then choose and play another cutaway gag
